        <li>The idea behind this system is to check the driver monitoring system which is used to save the humans life  
            in case of emergency risk Drivers must keep a close eye on the road, so they can react to sudden events  
            immediately.
            <br>
        <>Driver fatigue often becomes a direct cause of many traffic accidents. Therefore, there is a need  
            to develop the systems that will detect and notify a driver of her/him bad psychophysical condition, which  
            could significantly reduce the number of fatigue-related car accidents.
            <br>
        <li>This is becoming a common reason for signs of drowsiness and fatigue in drivers, including tiredness in eyes and yawning. One of the technical  
            possibilities to implement driver drowsiness detection systems is to use the vision-based approach. The  
            dataset uses left eye detection and right eye detection.</li>
        <li> With all the features, an OpenCV and keras a driver's fatigue or drowsiness model is built. The Validation results indicate the precision and accuracy of the proposed model<br></li>
